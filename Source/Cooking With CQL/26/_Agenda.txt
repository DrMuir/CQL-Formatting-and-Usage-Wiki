Stratifiers, Supplemental Data Elements, and Risk Adjustment Variables
[CQL Validation Messages](https://github.com/esacinc/CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki/wiki/CQL-Error-Messages)

For Stratifiers, Supplemental Data Elements, and Risk Adjustment Variables, we used the
draft contraceptive measure to illustrate building these components. The draft measure is included
in the examples for this session.

For CQL Validation Messages, we've developed a new topic on the CQL Formatting and Usage wiki that provides 
CQL authors with an overview of how validation is performed on CQL, the kinds of messages that it will produce,
and a catalog of validation messages that may be encountered when authoring CQL in tools like the Measure 
Authoring tool.

The new page is available in the [CQL Error Messages](https://github.com/esacinc/CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki/wiki/CQL-Error-Messages) topic.
